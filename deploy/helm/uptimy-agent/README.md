# Uptimy Agent

Open-source, self-hosted uptime monitoring that runs inside your cluster. It checks Services, databases and workloads by their internal names, alerts you when something goes down, and serves a public status page. One small Go binary, Apache-2.0.

- **Healthchecks:** HTTP(S) with status and keyword checks, TCP, ping, DNS, TLS certificate expiry, Postgres, MySQL and Redis (a real login and query), and Kubernetes Deployments, StatefulSets and DaemonSets with fewer ready replicas than they should have.
- **Heartbeats** for CronJobs, backups and workers: an interval or a cron schedule in any time zone, with missed and failed runs, exit codes and durations.
- **Alerts** by email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, Discord, Telegram, ntfy, PagerDuty, webhooks, Uptimy and 30+ more services through a Shoutrrr URL.
- **Status page** at `/status`, or on its own domain with nothing else exposed there, with your logo, sections, public names, incident updates and README badges. It never shows internal hostnames.
- **Auto-discovery:** label a Service, Ingress, HTTPRoute, workload or CronJob with `upti.my/monitor: "true"` and it's monitored within 30 seconds.
- **CronJobs without pings:** a labeled CronJob gets a heartbeat whose runs are read from its Jobs: start, finish, duration, and why it failed (exit code, OOMKilled).
- **Monitors in Git:** or put them in `values.yaml` and they're rendered into a ConfigMap.

## Install

```bash
helm install uptimy-agent oci://ghcr.io/uptimy/charts/uptimy-agent -n monitoring --create-namespace
kubectl -n monitoring logs deploy/uptimy-agent | grep -i password
kubectl -n monitoring port-forward svc/uptimy-agent 8080:80
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and sign in as `admin` with the password from the log. You'll choose your own straight away. Set `adminPassword` or `existingSecret` to skip that.

## Auto-discovery

Label what you want monitored. A Service gets an HTTP check on its cluster DNS name, on its pods' readinessProbe path (or a TCP connect for ports that aren't HTTP), an Ingress or HTTPRoute an HTTP check per hostname, a Deployment, StatefulSet or DaemonSet a readiness check, and a CronJob a heartbeat on its schedule whose runs are read from its Jobs, so the job needs no ping.

Put `upti.my/type: kubernetes` on a Service to reuse its pods' readinessProbes instead: it's up while it has a ready endpoint, with no traffic to the app. Without it, the check tests the real path through DNS, the Service and the app. Annotations adjust the check:

```yaml
metadata:
  labels:
    upti.my/monitor: "true"
  annotations:
    upti.my/name: Checkout API   # default: <namespace>/<name>
    upti.my/path: /health        # default: the readinessProbe path, else /
    upti.my/interval: 30s        # default: 1m
```

All annotations (`port`, `type`, `scheme`, `expected-status`, `keyword`, and `grace` for CronJobs) are in the [agent README](https://github.com/uptimy/agent#auto-discovery). Removing the label deletes the monitor. Discovery lists only labeled objects; turn it off with `discovery.enabled: false`.

## Monitors in values

Same schema as [`examples/monitors.yaml`](https://github.com/uptimy/agent/blob/main/examples/monitors.yaml). Monitors defined here are read-only in the UI, and changing them is a `helm upgrade`.

```yaml
healthchecks:
  - name: Checkout API
    type: http
    target: http://checkout.shop.svc.cluster.local:8080/health
    interval: 30s
  - name: Checkout deployment
    type: kubernetes
    target: shop/deployment/checkout
  - name: Postgres
    type: postgres
    target: postgres://monitor:${PG_PASSWORD}@postgres.shop.svc:5432/shop
heartbeats:
  - name: Nightly backup
    cron: "0 3 * * *"
    timezone: Europe/Berlin
    grace: 30m

# ${PG_PASSWORD} comes from a Secret, so it never lands in the ConfigMap.
extraEnv:
  - name: PG_PASSWORD
    valueFrom:
      secretKeyRef: { name: postgres-monitor, key: password }
```

## Public status page

Give the status page its own domain: set it under **Status page → Custom domain** in the UI (e.g. `status.example.com`) and expose only that host. On it the agent serves just the status page, at `/`, plus heartbeat ping URLs; sign-in, the API and `/metrics` return 404 there, so the dashboard stays private (`kubectl port-forward`, or a second host on an internal ingress class).

```yaml
ingress:
  enabled: true
  className: nginx
  annotations:
    cert-manager.io/cluster-issuer: letsencrypt
  hosts:
    - host: status.example.com
      paths: ["/"]
  tls:
    - secretName: status-tls
      hosts: [status.example.com]
```

## Values

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `image.repository` | `ghcr.io/uptimy/agent` | Image |
| `image.tag` | chart `appVersion` | Image tag |
| `adminPassword` | `""` | Password for `admin`; empty prints a random one to the log |
| `existingSecret` | `""` | Secret with key `ADMIN_PASSWORD` instead of `adminPassword` |
| `agentName` | release name | How the agent is labeled in Uptimy |
| `uptimy.heartbeatUrl` | `""` | Pin the Uptimy check-in URL (usually done with "Connect to Uptimy" in the UI) |
| `uptimy.existingSecret` | `""` | Secret with key `UPTIMY_HEARTBEAT_URL` |
| `healthchecks` / `heartbeats` | `[]` | Monitors defined in values |
| `retentionDays` | `30` | How long check results are kept |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.enabled` | `false` | Create a Prometheus Operator ServiceMonitor for `/metrics` |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.tokenSecret.name` / `.key` | `""` / `token` | Secret with an agent API token (read-only is enough); required when enabled |
| `metrics.serviceMonitor.interval` / `.labels` | `60s` / `{}` | Scrape interval, and labels your Prometheus selects on |
| `discovery.enabled` | `true` | Monitor resources labeled `upti.my/monitor: "true"` |
| `rbac.create` | `true` | Read-only access for checks (Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Services, EndpointSlices) and discovery (listing Services, Ingresses, HTTPRoutes, CronJobs, Jobs and pods) |
| `rbac.clusterWide` | `true` | `false` limits that access to the release namespace |
| `serviceAccount.create` / `.name` | `true` / `""` | Service account for Kubernetes checks |
| `persistence.enabled` | `true` | Keep data on a PVC (SQLite) |
| `persistence.size` / `.storageClass` / `.existingClaim` | `1Gi` / `""` / `""` | PVC settings |
| `service.type` / `.port` | `ClusterIP` / `80` | Service |
| `ingress.*` | disabled | Ingress; with the status page's custom domain as its host it serves only the status page |
| `resources` | 20m CPU, 32Mi request; 128Mi limit | Container resources |
| `extraEnv` | `[]` | Extra environment variables, e.g. passwords for `${VAR}` in targets |
| `nodeSelector` / `tolerations` / `affinity` / `podAnnotations` | empty | Scheduling and pod metadata |

The agent runs as a single replica (SQLite has one writer), as non-root with a read-only root filesystem and no capabilities. Ping checks use unprivileged ICMP sockets through the `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` sysctl.

## Watch the watcher

If the agent or the cluster goes down, nothing inside is left to tell you. **Settings → Connect to Uptimy** makes the agent check in with an [Uptimy](https://www.upti.my/?utm_source=artifacthub&utm_medium=chart&utm_campaign=agent) heartbeat every minute, and Uptimy alerts you from outside when it goes quiet.
